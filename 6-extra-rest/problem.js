/**
 * Consider a function that adds any arbitrary amount of numbers.
 * The function should be able to run successfully in these scenarios:
 * - sum(1, 2)
 * - sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
 * - sum(1, 2, 3)
 * - sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
 * 
 * => How can we achieve this with what we learned today?
 * Tip: Google "rest parameters in Javascript"
